				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Library is a course project for university course Web Application Developlemnt. It is a modified version of original idea which was to create a bookstore. Modification happened due to another project being turned into an online store, so this one got turned into an informative site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since this page is not suitable for backend development needed for the course, no more modifications will be added.
